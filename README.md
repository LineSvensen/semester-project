<b>Semester project as a part of my Front-end development education (Noroff)</b>

In this semester project for 2023, I am tasked with designing and developing a website for a 
children's science museum. The website's primary functions include ticket purchasing and 
information dissemination. 

The overarching design goal is to imbue the site with a modern and 
innovative aesthetic, balancing visual engagement with ease of navigation.
The site, targeting a diverse audience of children and parents, necessitates a delicate 
balance between child-friendliness and professionalism. Consistency is maintained across 
various elements, including colors, shapes, fonts, sizes, and spacing between items, 
contributing to a cohesive and user-friendly experience.

The timeline, informed by prior development experience, allows for adaptability, 
acknowledging the potential for adjustments in work dates due to varying task efficiencies.
Ultimately, the project aims to deliver a seamless website that not only meets functional 
requirements but also captivates visitors with an inviting and educational online 
experience.
