# Kids science museum
### Welcome! This repository houses the code for my "Kids science museum"-project, where i was tasked with designing and developing a website from scratch. The primary functions for the website include ticket purchasing and information. This is my semester project 2023, a part of my Front-end development education at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. Check out the webpage here: semester-project-xi.vercel.app

## Features 🌟

The webpage consists of 9 pages in total. The site works smoothly on different devices from width 360 px to 1440 px (most pages work outside these pixels too).
-	Buttons and navbar takes you to the different sites.
-	The page Success can be found by clicking the checkout button
-	The “register your mail page” can be found by clicking the Notify me-button
-	Hamburger menu will appear at width 1030 pixels
-	Interactive google map on the contact-page
-	Animated background at the “experience”-page
-	Can select amount of tickets on the “tickets”-page
-	Can pick a date on the “tickets”-page
-	Can enter your email in the email-field at the home-page

## Programs used 🛠️

-	Figma (UI, UX, Prototyping)
-	Canva (photo editing)
-	Unsplash (finding photos)
-	Webstorm (HTML, CSS)
-	Sourcetree (push project to Github)
-	Vercel (deploy webpage)
-	Github board (Project planning)
-	ChatGPT open ai (generating the made up information/story on the webpage)

## Project structure 📂

- Assets-200kb contain pictures
- All CSS are in the CSS folder

## Design Approach 🎨

The initial idea was to create an appealing site for children without making it overly childish, considering that parents primarily navigate and purchase tickets through the platform. After experimenting with various color palettes, I settled on a sophisticated yet fun combination of different shades of purple, purple-blue, rose-pink, yellow, and hints of orange for buttons. The color scheme aims to strike a balance between seriousness and vibrancy.

## Inspirations 👀

Inspiration for this project was drawn from various sources including Paradox Museum Oslo, ChildSci, Teknisk Museum, and Nasjonalmuseet. While these sites mostly facilitated ticket sales within their physical locations, my goal was to implement an online ticketing system for a seamless user experience.

## Development Process 💻

Originally planned for one week of design and three weeks of coding, the project timeline shifted to two weeks each for design and coding. I prioritized modern design elements and responsiveness, ensuring the site functions smoothly across various devices through extensive media queries. Optimizing image sizes to keep them under 200kb was essential for optimal site performance.

## Lessons Learned 📈

One of the primary challenges encountered revolved around understanding the dynamics of kids' science museums and their offerings. Leveraging memories of interactive experiences from my own childhood, I focused on highlighting these elements on the website while striking a balance between information and simplicity.Throughout this project, I learned the ease of implementing seemingly complex features. For instance, integrating a Google Map was as simple as copying and pasting google’s code. Utilizing grid layouts alongside flexbox improved the overall design flexibility. Consolidating common CSS elements like the navigation and footer into a single CSS file significantly streamlined the project and is a practice I aim to implement in future projects.Future improvements will include refining alignment on certain pages, especially when scaling down, and enhancing the "Tickets" and "Cart" pages for better alignment and user experience.
